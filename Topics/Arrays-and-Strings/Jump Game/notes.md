## Explanation

Use greedy approach

### Algorithm

1. Tracks the farthest index we can currently reach.
2. Loop through each index to simulate walking from left to right.
3. If our current position i is beyond the maxReach, we are stuck.
4. This means we cannot reach this index, so we return False.
5. From the current position i, you can jump to i + nums[i].
6. Update maxReach to be the farthest we've seen so far.
7. If at any point, we can already reach or surpass the last index, weâ€™re done.
8. Return True because reaching the end is possible.

## Test Cases

**Input:** nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
**Output**: True

**Input:** nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]
**Output**: False
