# Two Sum

## Topic
- Array
- Two Pointers

## Explanation

### Algorithm:

1. Create a hash map or dictionary.
2. Iterate through the array from the left, and for each value, calculate the complement as `(target - current value)`.
3. Check if the complement exists in the hash map:
   - If **yes**, return the pair of indices: `[complement_index, current_index]`.
   - If **no**, add the current value to the hash map with its index.
4. If no such pair is found after full traversal, return an empty array.

## ðŸ§ª Test Cases

```python
nums1 = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target1 = 9
output1 = [0, 1]

nums2 = [3, 2, 4]
target2 = 6
output2 = [1, 2]

nums3 = [3, 3]
target3 = 6
output3 = [0, 1]
```
